# Data Structures

![](README/0%20DS_Classification.jpg)

<p align="justify">
  A data structure is a collection of data type ‘values’ which are stored and organized in such a way that it allows for efficient access and modification. In some cases a data structure can become the underlying implementation for a particular data type.
</p>
<p align="justify">
For example, composite data types are data structures that are composed of primitive data types and/or other composite types, whereas an abstract data type will define a set of behaviours (almost like an ‘interface’ in a sense) for which a particular data structure can be used as the concrete implementation for that data type.
